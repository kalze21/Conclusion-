Generally, there are many areas in whcih active tissue engineering is being conducted. These areas include cardiovascular
tissues engineering with an emphasis on artificial heart muscle, blood vessels, valves, ventricles, and  
the whole bioartificial heart. In addition researchers are also focusing on components of the musculoskeletal system such as bone,  
cartilage, skeletal muscle, and tendons. The urinary system, which consists of kidneys, urinary bladder, ureters and urethras,   
is also included in tissue engineering. Tissue engineering of the respiratory system has focused on the production of artificial   
tracheas and artificial lung tissue. Tissue engineering for the digestive system has been focused on the development of artificial liver   
tissue, pancreas, intestine tissue, and esophageal tissue. Finally, researchers are also working in the development of artificial skin  
and attempting to solve issues related with central nervous system.
